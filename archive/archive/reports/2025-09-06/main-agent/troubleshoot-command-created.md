# Troubleshoot Command Creation Report

**Date:** 2025-09-06
**Task:** Create enhanced troubleshooting command
**Status:** Completed

## Summary

Successfully created an enhanced troubleshooting command that orchestrates specialized agents to diagnose and resolve various system issues.

## Command Overview

- **Name:** troubleshoot
- **Location:** `.claude/commands/troubleshoot.md`
- **Modes:** --simple (quick fixes), --complex (comprehensive analysis)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Issue Type Support
- Errors and exceptions
- Performance bottlenecks
- UI/UX problems
- Security vulnerabilities

### 2. Agent Orchestration
- **pr-reviewer:** Code quality diagnosis
- **planning-specialist:** Strategic resolution planning
- **research-specialist:** Root cause investigation
- **prototype-tester:** UI/UX validation
- **general-purpose:** Implementation execution

### 3. Workflow Structure
- **Simple Mode:** 2-phase quick diagnosis and targeted fixes
- **Complex Mode:** 4-phase comprehensive analysis with strategic planning

### 4. Parallelization Capabilities
- Simultaneous diagnostic agents for different subsystems
- Concurrent performance profiling and log analysis
- Parallel testing environments

## Improvements Over Previous Version

1. Added multi-issue type support (error, performance, UI, security)
2. Implemented agent orchestration with specialized roles
3. Created dual-mode operation (simple vs complex)
4. Enhanced parallelization opportunities
5. Added comprehensive memory bank references
6. Improved deliverables with detailed reports

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Simple error fix
troubleshoot error @src/api/handler.ts "API returns 500 error" --simple

# Complex performance analysis
troubleshoot performance @src/components/ "App loads slowly" --complex

# Security vulnerability scan
troubleshoot security "Check for SQL injection risks" --complex
```

## Verification

- Command file validated against template structure
- All required sections present and correctly formatted
- Agent references verified against registry
- Tool permissions appropriately scoped

## Next Steps

Consider creating specialized agents if not already present:
- Security specialist agent for vulnerability assessment
- Performance engineer for optimization tasks
- Error recovery specialist for complex debugging
