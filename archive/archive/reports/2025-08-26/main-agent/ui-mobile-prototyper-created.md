## Reflection

### Approach Taken

I created a comprehensive ui-mobile-prototyper agent following the standard template structure with detailed responsibilities covering mobile-first prototype development, responsive mobile layouts, touch interaction patterns, and mobile form optimization.

- **Key Decision 1:** Used standard mode to create a comprehensive agent with 4 core responsibilities
- **Key Decision 2:** Selected appropriate tools including WebSearch for researching mobile patterns
- **Key Decision 3:** Focused on touch interactions and mobile-specific constraints
- **Key Decision 4:** Emphasized PWA capabilities for offline functionality

### Alternative Approaches that could have been taken

- Could have included more browser automation tools for testing prototypes
- Could have added Playwright tools for automated mobile testing
- Could have separated iOS and Android prototyping into different agents

### Improvement Suggestions

- Consider adding specific mobile framework integration (like Ionic or Framework7)
- Include mobile performance profiling tools and metrics
- Add collaboration instructions with other prototyping agents (desktop, web)
- Include specific mobile gesture libraries recommendations
