## Reflection

### Approach Taken

Following the standard agent creation process, I generated a comprehensive UX Specialist agent that aligns with the provided role description and project requirements.

- **Key Decision 1:** Selected Sonnet model for efficiency in research and documentation tasks
- **Key Decision 2:** Included Sequential Thinking tool for complex UX analysis workflows
- **Key Decision 3:** Organized responsibilities into three clear categories: Research, Architecture, and Documentation

### Alternative Approaches that could have been taken

- Could have used Opus model for more complex UX research tasks
- Could have included additional tools like Bash for prototype testing scripts
- Could have separated into two agents: UX Researcher and Information Architect

### Improvement Suggestions

- Consider adding integration points with UI Designer agent for design handoffs
- Add specific templates for user persona and journey map deliverables
- Include references to existing UX patterns in the NEXLY RN project
