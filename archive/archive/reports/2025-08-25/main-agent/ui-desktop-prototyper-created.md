- `.claude/agents/CLAUDE.md` - Updated agent registry description

## Reflection

### Approach Taken

Used sequential thinking to structure the agent creation process systematically. The implementation followed the standard mode template with 3 core responsibilities and 3 use cases.

- **Key Decision 1:** Used Sonnet model as specified for optimal performance with prototyping tasks
- **Key Decision 2:** Focused tools on Write, Read, Edit, WebSearch for prototype creation needs
- **Key Decision 3:** Emphasized desktop-specific features to differentiate from ui-web-prototyper

### Alternative Approaches that could have been taken

- Could have used complete mode for more detailed agent definition
- Could have added more specialized tools like Playwright for testing prototypes
- Could have included more integration points with other design team agents

### Improvement Suggestions

- Consider adding integration workflows with prototype-tester agent
- Add specific examples of prototype deliverables in the agent file
- Consider adding CSS framework preferences for consistency
