# Scripts Folder Cleanup Report

**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Task**: Clean up unnecessary files in /workspace/scripts/  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up the scripts folder by removing broken scripts and updating documentation to match the actual available scripts.

## Changes Made

### Files Deleted (2)
1. **launch-all.sh** - Removed because it referenced non-existent worktrees
2. **track-changes.sh** - Removed due to hardcoded Windows paths that made it non-portable

### Files Updated (2)
1. **README.md** - Completely rewritten to document actual scripts present
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated to remove references to non-existent scripts

### Files Retained (5)
1. **launch-new-claude.sh** - Basic Claude launcher
2. **launch-resume-claude.sh** - Resume Claude sessions  
3. **launch-new-claude-yolo.sh** - Auto-yes mode launcher (used by init-shortcuts.sh)
4. **launch-resume-claude-yolo.sh** - Auto-yes resume (used by init-shortcuts.sh)
5. **setup-yolo-aliases.sh** - Shell alias configuration

## Key Findings

- YOLO scripts are integrated with `.devcontainer/init-shortcuts.sh` and must be retained
- Documentation was significantly out of sync with actual scripts
- Several scripts referenced worktree structures that no longer exist

## Results

- **Before**: 9 scripts (2 broken, 2 redundant initially thought)
- **After**: 7 files total (5 functional scripts + 2 documentation files)
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more maintainable scripts folder with accurate documentation

## Integration Points Preserved

- Development container shortcuts continue to work
- YOLO aliases remain functional
- All referenced scripts in init-shortcuts.sh are preserved

## Recommendations

1. Consider creating a new worktree management script if needed
2. Add version tracking to scripts to prevent future documentation drift
3. Test scripts periodically to ensure they remain functional

## Compliance

- ✅ Followed documentation rules from @docs/rules/documentation-rules.md
- ✅ Maintained atomic changes
- ✅ Preserved existing integrations
- ✅ Updated all related documentation
