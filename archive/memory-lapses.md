# Memory Lapses (Avoid This)

## 1. Overcomplicating an implementation when we are just building for MVP
- **Problem:** Too much overhead, too complex approach
- **Solution:** Think simple. Focus on lean approach. Remember to always build for MVP

## 2. Not Writing Tests first
- **Problem:** You go straight to writing code immediately
- **Solution:** Always write tests first. Follow TDD workflow strictly

## 3. Overdocumenting Specs 
- **Problem:** You overdocument, overbloat a documentation specs
- **Solution:** Write lean, concise documentation. Always think about reducing the size of the documentation file.
