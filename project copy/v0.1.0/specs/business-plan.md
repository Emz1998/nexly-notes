## Company Description

### Vision Statement

NEXLY RN empowers nursing students to capture knowledge faster, so they can focus on becoming exceptional nurses.

### Core Principles

1. **Speed Over Features** — Every feature must make note-taking faster. If it adds friction, it doesn't ship.
2. **Nursing-First Design** — Medical terminology, nursing templates, and clinical formulas are first-class citizens.
3. **Reliability Is Non-Negotiable** — Students trust us with their academic success. Auto-save and offline support are foundational.
4. **Simple by Default** — One editing mode. Clean UI. No cognitive overhead.

## Problem Statement

Nursing students face a unique challenge: absorbing massive amounts of complex medical information while juggling lectures, clinicals, and exam prep. Current solutions fail them:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Generic tools don't speak nursing** | AI autocomplete in Notion or Google Docs doesn't understand medical terminology, forcing manual typing of complex drug names and pathophysiology terms |
| **Manual formatting wastes time** | Creating care plans, medication cards, and SOAP notes takes 5-10 minutes per note when students need real-time capture |
| **Critical formulas are hard to recall** | During exams and clinicals, students struggle to remember dosage calculations and assessment formulas |
| **Unreliable sync causes anxiety** | Losing notes during clinical rotations or laptop failures is unacceptable when that content determines exam success |

---

## Solution

NEXLY RN is a focused note editor built specifically for nursing students combining three powerful capabilities:

### 1. AI-Powered Medical Autocomplete

Real-time AI suggestions for medical terms as students type. When offline or over quota, a 5,000+ term nursing dictionary provides seamless fallback. Students never lose momentum.

### 2. Nursing-Specific Slash Commands

**Templates** (`/template`):
- Care Plans (Nursing Diagnosis → Goals → Interventions → Evaluation)
- Medication Cards (Drug → Classification → Action → Dose → Side Effects → Nursing Considerations)
- SOAP Notes (Subjective → Objective → Assessment → Plan)
- Head-to-Toe Assessments
- Pathophysiology Outlines

**Formulas** (`/formula`):
- MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure): Normal 70-100 mmHg
- BMI (Body Mass Index): Normal 18.5-24.9
- IV Drip Rates
- Dosage Calculations
- Glasgow Coma Scale (3-15)

### 3. Bulletproof Offline Sync

Notes save locally every 30 seconds and sync to the cloud automatically. Edit during clinicals without WiFi. Never lose work.

## Success Metrics

### MVP Validation Criteria (2 weeks, 50 beta users)

| Metric | Green Light | Yellow Light | Red Light |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Slash command adoption | ≥60% use in week 1 | 40-59% | <40% |
| AI autocomplete acceptance | ≥40% | 25-39% | <25% |
| User feedback | "Faster than current method" | Mixed | "No different" |
| Sync reliability | ≥99% | 95-98% | <95% |

### Decision Framework

- **Green Light (Keep Building):** Users adopt slash commands, report speed improvements, and data syncs reliably
- **Yellow Light (Iterate):** Features discovered but underused; improve onboarding and discoverability
- **Red Light (Pivot):** Users don't see value vs. Google Docs; fundamental value proposition needs rethinking

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **User Adoption** — Students don't discover slash commands | Medium | High | Onboarding demo, in-editor tooltips, early adoption tracking |
| **Competition** — Notion/Google adds nursing features | Low | High | Move fast, build community, focus on depth competitors won't match |
| **Cost Overrun** — AI API costs exceed revenue | Medium | Medium | Request-based quotas, dictionary fallback, weekly cost monitoring |
| **Churn** — Students graduate or take summer breaks | High | Medium | Annual pricing incentive, NCLEX prep features for graduating students |

---

## Conclusion

NEXLY RN addresses a clear market gap with a focused, nursing-specific solution. With a low break-even point, strong competitive differentiation, and a growing target market, the business is positioned for sustainable growth.

**The opportunity is clear:** 200,000+ nursing students graduate annually, and none of the current tools serve their unique needs. NEXLY RN will.
