> Pattern-match against these cases when facing similar situations.
> Add cases when bad outputs occur or good patterns emerge — this is the project's living "case law."

## [Category Name]

<!-- e.g., Scope, Tone, Uncertainty, Code Style, Domain -->

### Case: [Short Descriptive Name]

<!-- e.g., Save Button Overengineering, Inventing API Methods, Verbose Explanation -->

**Scenario:** [What was asked]

<!-- e.g., "Add a button that saves the note" -->

**Bad Output:**

> [What was produced incorrectly]

<!-- e.g., 45-line component with loading states, toasts, error handling, timestamps -->

**Why bad:** [Optional — include when contrast isn't obvious]

<!-- e.g., Added features that weren't requested, scope creep -->

**Good Output:**

> [What it should have been]
