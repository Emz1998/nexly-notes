# Reformatting Rules

## Core Rules

- **Critical** Retain the same information. Only paraphrase but do not remove any information
- No emojis or tables when documenting in a markdown file
- Prefer using lists (bullet points `-`  or numbered lists) over paragraphs
- Do not use `*` as a bullet point
- Use bold (**) to highlight titles and important information
- Use italic (*) for additional/special instructions
- Use code blocks (```) for code snippets
- Use ` ` backticks for inline code snippets and also for some keywords
- Max 3 header levels (#, ##,###)
- Prefer conciseness and simplicity than overexplaining, overengineering and overdocumenting
- Do not bloat it 
- Use **Important!** for very important information you want to remember
- Prefer simple and concise natural language over complex and verbose natural language
