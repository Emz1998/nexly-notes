# Commands Configuration Rules

## Core Rules

1. Always analyze the existing commands in the directory and follow the same structure and approach
2. Do not overbloat the file with too much information. Keep it concise and to the point. Follow the structure and approach of the existing commands.
3. For existing files, only extend sections with new content or remove only duplicates. Do not change the existing content unless explicitly requested.
4. Consult user before major structural changes
5. Only modify when explicitly requested
6. All new commands must include context-memory management section
