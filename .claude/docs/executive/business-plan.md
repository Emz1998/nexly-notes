# NEXLY RN — Business Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** 4-Week MVP Phase

---

## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

Nursing students face a critical challenge: existing note-taking tools force them to choose between speed (fast capture) and learning effectiveness (review and study features). Current solutions either optimize for one workflow or combine everything into a cluttered interface that slows down both.

### The Solution

NEXLY RN is an AI-powered nursing education platform that transforms study notes into active learning material through three distinct, optimized modes:

1. **Create Mode** — Fast capture with AI autocomplete and minimal UI
2. **Edit Mode** — Revision with inline diff view to track changes
3. **Study Mode** — AI-powered key term spotting to identify exam-relevant content

### Market Opportunity

- **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** 3.5M nursing students in the US
- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** 500K tech-savvy nursing students (early adopters)
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** 25K users in Year 1

### Business Model

Freemium SaaS with three tiers:
- **Free Tier:** $0/month (100 AI requests/month, 10 key term uses/month)
- **Pro Tier:** $8.99/month or $79/year (unlimited AI features)
- **Team/Educator Tier:** $19.99/month per seat (institutional features)

### Financial Highlights (Year 1 Projections)

- **Target Users:** 25,000 registered users
- **Conversion Rate:** 15% Free → Pro
- **Projected ARR:** $404,550
- **Gross Margin:** ~65% (after AI costs)
- **Break-even:** Month 8

### Funding Request

**Seeking:** $150,000 seed funding for 12-month runway

**Use of Funds:**
- Development & MVP validation: $60,000 (40%)
- Marketing & user acquisition: $45,000 (30%)
- AI infrastructure & costs: $30,000 (20%)
- Operations & legal: $15,000 (10%)

### The Ask

We are seeking $150,000 in seed funding to:
1. Launch 4-week MVP to 50 beta users
2. Validate three-mode hypothesis with real nursing students
3. Scale to 25,000 users in Year 1
4. Achieve product-market fit and position for Series A
