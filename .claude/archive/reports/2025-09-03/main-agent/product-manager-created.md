## Reflection

### Approach Taken

Used sequential thinking to design a comprehensive product manager agent focused on strategic planning rather than implementation.

- **Key Decision 1:** Placed agent in planning category rather than creating executive-team category
- **Key Decision 2:** Selected tools focused on research and documentation rather than code editing
- **Key Decision 3:** Emphasized proactive use for product strategy and prioritization tasks

### Alternative Approaches that could have been taken

- Create new executive-team category for senior-level agents
- Include more technical tools for product managers who code
- Use minimal mode for simpler agent definition

### Improvement Suggestions

- Consider adding mcp__zen tools for collaborative planning
- Add WebFetch for detailed competitive analysis
- Include integration with existing planning-specialist agent
