**Overall Satisfaction Level:** 10/10

## Execution Summary

### What Was Requested
Create a comprehensive Lead Prototyper agent specializing in cross-platform prototype architecture and team leadership.

### What Was Completed

- Created lead-prototyper agent with opus model for complex decisions. [Satisfaction Level: 10/10]
- Positioned as team lead in design-team CLAUDE.md. [Satisfaction Level: 10/10]
- Updated main registry with leadership designation. [Satisfaction Level: 10/10]

## Reflection

### Approach Taken

Utilized sequential thinking to architect a senior-level agent with comprehensive cross-platform expertise. The implementation emphasized leadership responsibilities and architectural decision-making authority.

- **Key Decision 1:** Used Opus model for complex architectural and leadership decisions
- **Key Decision 2:** Included TodoWrite and Sequential Thinking tools for task coordination
- **Key Decision 3:** Positioned agent first in team list to reflect leadership hierarchy

### Alternative Approaches that could have been taken

- Could have created separate lead agents for each platform (desktop, mobile, web)
- Could have split into technical lead and people management roles
- Could have added Task tool for direct subagent orchestration

### Improvement Suggestions

- Consider adding direct integration with other prototyper agents
- Add specific handoff workflows to development teams
- Include metrics and performance benchmarking capabilities
- Consider adding code generation tools for prototype scaffolding
